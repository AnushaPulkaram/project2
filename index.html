    module), as well as additional <em>Action handlers</em>. For example, changes in business processes<br>
or operational workflows result in the need for exchanging new messages. New <em>Action<br>
handlers</em> can be implemented for processing these messages and the <em>Controller</em> can be<br>
easily configured to dispatch the appropriate message to the dedicated <em>Action handler</em>.<br><br>
<em>Presentation Layer services</em>. The <em>Presentation layer services</em> of the framework contain<br>
a set of tools and methods targeting the development of adaptive XML-based user<br>
interface modules. Using these tools and methods one can assemble user interface<br>
modules from XML documents. We call these documents user interface documents. An<br>
example of such a document is shown on Figure 7.<br>
    
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p2">The key elements of the user interface document are:</div><br>
    
    <ol type="1">
        
        <li><em>Serializable User Interface Components:</em> The framework provides a set of common<br>
visual controls like menus, text boxes, buttons, list boxes, and so on that support<br>
XML serialization and a set of specialized user interface controls for handling the<br>
framework’s data model that also support XML serialization. These controls<br>
support direct binding to framework’s message structures. Serializable forms and<br>
dialogs are also available as part of the framework. An example definition of such<br>
components is shown on part A of Figure 7.</li><br>
        <li><em>Serializable non-visual Components:</em> A <em>user interface document</em> contains also<br>
XML descriptions targeting non-visual components of the framework that also<br>
support XML serialization. These components undertake a set of operations such<br>
as sending and receiving documents to/from the <em>Controller</em>, sending and receiving<br>
documents to/from different devices, such as printers or file systems and trans-<br>forming documents. An example definition of such components is shown on part<br>
B of Figure 7. A complete user interface module is a collection of objects capable<br>
of accepting and producing XML descriptions. We call these objects <em>Xml objects</em>.<br>
New <em>Xml objects</em> can be created by anyone planning to extend the user interface<br>
infrastructure of the framework. The basic interface of an <em>Xml objects</em> contains only<br>
three operations: the <em>Describe</em> operation supporting the initial definition and<br>
construction of the object based on an XML description, the <em>LoadXml</em> operation<br>
supporting the loading of an XML description from the object, and the <em>Xml</em><br>
operation supporting the generation of an XML description by the object.</li><br>
        
        <li>
        <em>Data Exchange between Xml Objects:</em> The exchange of data between different <em>Xml<br>
Objects</em> makes use of XSLT transformations to restructure XML descriptions<br>
generated from one type of object to descriptions suitable for loading from another<br>
            type of object. An example of a transformation is shown on part C of Figure 7.<br></li><br>
        <li>
        <em>XML Description of Data Flow:</em> An XML vocabulary has been defined in order to<br>
describe the data flow among <em>Xml Jobs</em>. We call these descriptions <em>Xml Jobs</em>.<br>
The <em>Xml Jobs</em> behave as event handlers for the <em>Xml Jobs</em>. An example of an <em>Xml<br>
Job</em> is shown on part D of Figure 7.
        
        </li><br>
       
        </ol>
    This approach results in an open and extensible set of tools capable of describing and<br>
implementing client side business logic modules portable to different platforms and<br>
environments.<br><br><br><br><br>

    <p>From our experience in developing and using our framework, we would like to emphasize<br>
the following:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li> Using XML not only as the format for exchanged data but also for the native<br>
environment for business logic description, UI description, and business objects<br>
definition results in a rich metadata repository, providing true customization<br>
capabilities, enabling independent UI development and allowing the transition to<br>
future technologies.</li><br><br><br><br><br>
        
       
    <li> Inherent support of messaging standards assists in achieving the interoperability<br>
requirement.</li>
        <li> The adoption of messaging communication protocol (realized through the adop-<br>tion of Web Services) leads to a loosely-coupled architecture that also contributes<br>
to the extensibility and better maintenance of the delivered software.<br></li>
    </ol><br><br><br>
    <div class="p2">
    Our approach in the application framework development up to now concentrates more<br>
on providing basic functionality to the developer in order to deliver quickly robust<br>
applications. As a result, our framework lacks the wide support to other standards like<br>
DICOM. However, now we have acknowledged the value of such support in order to<br>
cover the entire HC domain.<br>

    <h3>What the Future Holds</h3>
    </center>
    <div class="hl"><hr></div>
    <div>
    Nowadays it is commonly accepted that standardization at all levels is more than critical.<br>
Efforts for harmonization among several standardization bodies in the area of HC, give<br>
hope for achieving one global set of standards in the future.<br><br>
Rouggery (2003) at the purpose section of <em>Web Services Profile</em> presenting its scope,<br>
more or less describes the future as follows: “The ideal situation that we will be looking<br>
at is a HC environment where “plug-n-play” interoperability via Web Services is a reality.<br>
In this environment Independent Software Vendors (ISV) and corporate developers<br>
implementing HL7 interfaces can write generic and reusable classes, subroutines, and<br>
modules consistent with the guidelines set forth by the HL7 standard for Web Services<br>
standards in order to handle HL7 message traffic from a potentially unlimited number of<br>
connecting applications and services. Applications that “expose” HL7 messages (e.g.,<br>
Web Services servers) will do so according to the HL7 Web Services Profile (WSP)<br>
guidelines; “consumers” of HL7 messages (e.g., Web Services clients) can be written<br>
without prior knowledge of the application that they will ultimately end up talking to. In<br>
addition, this “plug-n-play” environment will take advantage of supporting discovery<br>
protocols such as UDDI to break the rigidity of the current hard-coded message routing<br>
infrastructures of most Healthcare enterprises”. We can not be certain, that the widely<br>
adopted standard for HC messaging in the future will be the HL7; but it’s very likely to<br>
witness such a scenario. Web Services for sure will play a very important role in the future<br>
of HC informatics.</div>
    <center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>
    <div class="hl"><hr></div>
    <div>The healthcare sector is characterized by a continuously growing competition for<br>
survival under difficult economic conditions of scarce resources and limited growth with<br>
the constant threat of tightened regulations, public scrutiny, and negative media</div><br><br><br>
    <br><br><br>
    <div>
    exposure. Consequently, HC providers are increasingly seeking opportunities in the<br>
information technology (IT) field to operate more effectively and efficiently, and to<br>
reduce the overall costs of healthcare delivery while improving the quality (Ashry &<br>
Taylor, 2000).</div><br>
    <div>The HC software community is moving towards the notions of openness (based on<br>
officially approved and globally acceptable standards) and modularity to tackle the<br>
integration challenge (Blobel & Holena, 1997, p. 24). Open architectures based on<br>
officially approved and globally acceptable standards can contribute to interoperability.<br>
The high rate of change creates the need for systems that have the ability to evolve and<br>
adapt to the new conditions without excessive cost. Modular software design enables<br>
best of breed modules—handling emerging and even unpredictable user or unit require-<br>ment—sto be gradually added into the systems and successfully glued within the overall,<br>
distributed architecture.<br></div><br>
    <div>In order to achieve the above goal, there is a need for a systematic way of developing<br>
applications targeting the <em>Applications layer</em>. An effective means to realize it is the use<br>
of Application Frameworks. Such Application Frameworks should make use of the<br>
existing standards in order to reap the benefits of the significant work done in the domain,<br>
presenting the knowledge that lies within the standards and thus introducing them in<br>
daily use.<br></div><br>
    <div>The use of Application Frameworks will result in achieving interoperability within HIS<br>
both on a functional and on conceptual level, reinforcing the role Hospital Information<br>
Systems play in healthcare.</div><br><br><br>
